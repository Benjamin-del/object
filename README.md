# Ben's RST

This is my RST that uses ML to analize images and tell you what it thinks it is.


## How to run (venv)

1. Create a Virtual Enviroment by running `python3 -m venv object` 
2. Activate the Virtual Enviroment by running `source bin/activate`
3. Install All Dependencies (Timm, Torch, Flask, Flask_basicauth)
4. Clone Repo the the object folder. Ensure you have `/model_data` and `config.json`
5. Run app.py with `python3 app.py`
6. Visit the site! The Admin Password should be in config.json!
